Catherine Harty

Worked with Theodore Fessaras, Desi Pilla, Samuel Matylewicz, and Melvin Tejada. We all split up this week and communicated in a group chat instead.
The only person I worked with in person was Theodore. We each did what we could on our own, and if we got stuck, we would ask for help in the groupchat.
Every person gave feedback and helped at least once.
