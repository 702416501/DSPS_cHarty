Worked with Desi Pilla, Theodore Fessaras, and Samuel Matylewicz.

I worked on the beginning part of the lab by myself, consulting with my group members on it. 
Desi was responsible for the second part of the homework. 
He finished the second part of the before any of the other group members got a chance to look at it, so we double checked 
his code and made sure everything worked and consulted with one another. All the contacting was done over Groupme, not in person.
