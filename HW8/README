My plot focused on the average price per avocado in 4 different cities in different regions of the US over the course of 2 years (2016-2018). 
The places focused on were Atlanta, GA, Philadelphia, PA, Denver, CO, and Chicago, IL. I used the default python colors, and gave
each dataset a different shape to make it more color blind friendly. I also made the data somewhat transparent so no points are 
completely hidden. The results showed that avocados sold in Denver and Atlanta tend to be cheaper than avocados sold in Chicago and Philadelphia.
