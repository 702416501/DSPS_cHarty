Worked with Theodore Fessaras, Desi Pilla, Samuel Matylewicz.
For Part 1:
I worked on the first part of the lab by myself, then did the rest of it with Theodore Fessaras. We then both compared our answers to the other group memebers after we had all finished it.
For Part 2: I worked on this entire part with Theodore Fessaras and compared answers to the other group members over Groupme.
