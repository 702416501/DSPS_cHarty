Partners were Theodore Fessaras, Melvin Tejada, Samuel Matylewicz, and Desi Pilla.
We all met for 9 hours on Saturday.
Theodore Fessaras put his google colab on a TV in the room we all worked in, so we could talk about each part of the project together. We each talked through every part of the project
and shared our ideas, then we compared and finalized our codes until we all got the same results. None of us did a specific part, we just all worked together on each part.
