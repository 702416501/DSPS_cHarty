Partners were Theodore Fessaras, Melvin Tejada, Samuel Matylewicz, and Desi Pilla
We all met for 9 hours on Saturday.
Theodore Fessaras put his google colab on a TV in the room we all worked in. We each talked through every part of the project
and shared our ideas, then we compared our codes. None of us did a specific part, we just all worked together on each part.
